# PreRecordium  
**🎙️ The Recorder That Records The Past**

---

## Version 1.7.6

PreRecordium is a lightweight, powerful app that lets you save **audio from the past 2 minutes** — even if you didn’t hit record beforehand.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

If PreRecordium is live and running, it constantly listens and stores a rolling buffer of the past 120 seconds (or more, if you choose). When something worth saving happens, just hit **"Get Recording"** — and boom, it grabs the audio from the past!
